# program to print all the prime number in given interval
# In most of the programming languages (C/C++, Java, etc), 
# the use of else statement has been restricted with the if conditional statements. 
# But Python also allows us to use the else condition with for loops. 
# The else block just after for/while is executed only 
# when the loop is NOT terminated by a break statement.
